## Interesting functions 

### AUR package management

Most of these expect $AUR_DIR to be set, the location of a directory where AUR
package git repos will be cloned. `.local/share/aur` is a reasonable choice.

For more info about the AUR see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository

* [`aurc`](functions/aurc.fish): Install a package from the AUR.
* [`aurs`](functions/aurs.fish): Search the AUR for a given string.
* [`aur-sync`](functions/aur-sync.fish): Downloads the latest AUR package list. Not currently used for anything ðŸ˜…
* [`aur-disappeared`](funcions/aur-disappeared.fish): Display a list of locally installed packages that have been removed from the AUR.
